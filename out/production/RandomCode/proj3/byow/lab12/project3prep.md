# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer:

While what I did was similar to the solution in lab, their solution to where
to place the hexagons was much more thought out. I should have thought about
the challenges of using the top left corner of the hexagon more

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer:Perhaps a good analogy would be the randomized rooms on the map
trying to find a good way to connect them all, just like the tessalation 
of hexagons.


**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer:

I would most likely start working on specific classes and helper methods that represent
rooms and sprites.
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: A hallways connects two rooms together, while a room is a large amount of space
